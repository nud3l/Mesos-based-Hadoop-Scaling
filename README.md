# Mesos based Hadoop scaling
## TU Delft/IN4392 Cloud Computing Seminar
Checkmetrix brings data-analytics and connectivity
possibilities within the reach of small retailers. With this solution
small businesses store their sales information centrally in a
cloud environment and receive periodic as well as on-demand
reports based on metrics. To enable the creation of reports,
MapReduce jobs are created. As reports can be received any
time, an automatic scaling and provisioning of virtual machines
(VMs) is created to cope with the unpredictable demands. The
auto-scaling is further used to reduce the number of VMs when
the cluster is idle. We show in experiments that auto-scaling of
Hadoop clusters is possible. We further elaborate that the time
to execute MapReduce jobs is decreased by up to 13% within
busy clusters due to auto-scaling. We further present that the
cluster scales down during idle times while remaining a consistent
Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
